            <h3>Bio</h3>
               <p><b>SavvyCakes</b> is a 4.5 year old domestic short haired tabby cat 🐈. She became a part of the family 👩🏾‍👧🏽‍👧🏽🏠 2.5 years ago in February of 2021. She is a very calm, nice and loving 😻 cat who absolutely LOVES to be pet. One funny thing about SavvyCakes is that she will literally come in front of someone, plop down on her side suddenly and then stare 👀 at you until you pet her lol. Ayana actually picked Savvy out from a local shelter here in Kansas City called Wayside Waifs. Savvy has been a joy ✨ to have and I look forward to many more years of love and memories with her. 💜</p>

In 2012, we moved to Saint George, SC and had our second child 👶🏽, Aidan. It was also there that he started his career as a machinist 🧑🏽‍🏭. Unfortunately we lost him to gun violence on April 11, 2014. 💔<br>Although he is no longer with us physically, I know if he were here he would be proud of every single one of us 💙💜</p>
