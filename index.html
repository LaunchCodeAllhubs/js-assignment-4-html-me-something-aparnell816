            <h3>Bio</h3>
               <p><b>SavvyCakes</b> is a 4.5 year old domestic short haired tabby cat 🐈. She became a part of the family 👩🏾‍👧🏽‍👧🏽🏠 2.5 years ago in February of 2021. She is a very calm, nice and loving 😻 cat who absolutely LOVES to be pet. One funny thing about SavvyCakes is that she will literally come in front of someone, plop down on her side suddenly and then stare 👀 at you until you pet her lol. Ayana actually picked Savvy out from a local shelter here in Kansas City called Wayside Waifs. Savvy has been a joy ✨ to have and I look forward to many more years of love and memories with her. 💜</p>
